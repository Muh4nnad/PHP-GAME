we put it on https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier and we found out its Writing in Reverse

now we got this message and we can see its telling us to check the spaces so lets watch it again

we can see there something in the spaces there is to type of the spaces we have in the text short space and long space and the name of the file is beep

after i searched i found out morse code

so the short beep is dot (.) and long beep is dash (-) 

so now i will replace short space with (.) and long space with (-)

now lets take the . and - to morse code decoder https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html
